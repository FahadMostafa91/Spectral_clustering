# Spectral_clustering
Spectral clustering refers to a family of algorithms that cluster eigenvectors derived from the matrix that represents the input dataâ€™s graph. An important step in this method is running the kernel function that is applied on the input data to generate a NXN similarity matrix or graph (where N is our number of input observations). Subsequent steps include computing the normalised graph Laplacian from this similarity matrix, getting the eigensystem of this graph, and lastly applying k-means on the top K eigenvectors to get the K clusters. Clustering in this way adds flexibility in the range of data that may be analyzed and spectral clustering will often outperform k-means.
